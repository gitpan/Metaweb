Metaweb

This is a Perl interface to the Metaweb database, best known through the
application Freebase (http://freebase.com).  Freebase is currently in
alpha release, with world-readable data but requiring an invitation and
login to be able to update/write data.

This module is very much alpha code.  It has lots of stuff not
implemented and will undergo significant changes.  Breakage may occur
between versions, so consider yourself warned.
