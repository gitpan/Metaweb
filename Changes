Revision history for Metaweb

0.03    2007-09-09
        * Previous version was missing the command line tool, 'metaweb'.
          This has now been added to the MANIFEST so it should install
          correctly.

0.02    2007-08-24
        * Now includes 'metaweb' command line script for easy command line
          fiddling.
        * json_query() now does writes as well as reads; query() doesn't
          support writes yet, though.
        * Changed API for json_query().  Now expects envelope (though
          you can have it added for you it using the add_envelope arg).
        * Documentation improvements, mostly in the general description area.
